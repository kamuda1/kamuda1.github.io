<font size="4"> <p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/kamuda1/stochastic-race" target="_blank"><strong>Stochastic Race</strong></a> was inspired by a p5.js example titled <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-tickle.html" target="_blank">Tickle</a>. The goal of the game is to use your mouse to get the green rectangle home before the enemy red rectangle.
