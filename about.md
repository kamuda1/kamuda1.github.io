	<p>I currently work as a machine learning engineer and software developer. Previously I was a grad student in the <a href="http://arfc.github.io">Advanced Reactor and Fuel Cycle</a> group at the <a href="https://npre.illinois.edu/">Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. My PhD research focused on applying machine learning to pattern recognition problems in nuclear security and nuclear treaty verification. As a part of my research, I developed <a href="https://github.com/kamuda1/annsa">annsa</a>, a Python package for gamma-ray spectroscopy dataset prototyping and deep learning using TensorFlow.
